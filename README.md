# whats-it-mean

This project is a side project.

At this stage this is how I see it heading:

A TypeScript front end with a connection to Google Firebase

The front end will call CarJam's test API (https://dev.carjam.co.nz/2017/04/09/abcd-low-cost-vehicle-details/) to retrieve basic car details with search by number plate.

The user then can update the description for the number plate IF the plate is deemed to be personalised. 
A custom function will check if the plate is personalised. This information is stored in Firebase.

At this stage there is no need for a backend.
